\section{Background concepts}\label{sec:background}

This section describes briefly the P4 programming language and
eBPF. Some of the text is adapted from~\cite{budiu-osr17}
and~\cite{p4-ebpf-backend}.

\subsection{The P4 programming language}

\mycomment{(This section is adapted from~\cite{budiu-osr17}.)}
P4 is a relatively
simple, statically-typed programming language, with a syntax based on
C, designed to express transformations of network packets.

The core abstractions provided by the P4 language are listed in
Figure~\ref{fig:abstractions}.  P4 lacks many common features found in
other programming languages: for example, P4 has \textbf{no} support
for pointers, dynamic memory allocation, floating-point numbers, or
recursive functions; looping constructs are only allowed within
parsers.

P4 emphasizes static resource allocation; unlike systems such as the
Linux \texttt{tc} subsystem, in P4 all packet processing rules and all tables
must be declared when the P4 program is created.


\subsection{P4 Architectures}

P4 allows programs to execute on arbitrary \emph{targets}.  Targets
differ in their functionality, (e.g., a switch has to forward packets,
a network card has to receive or transmit packets, and a firewall has
to block or allow packets), and also in their custom capabilities
(e.g., ASICs may provide associative TCAM memories or custom checksum
computation hardware units, while an FPGA switch may allow users to
implement custom queueing disciplines).  P4 embraces this diversity of
targets and provides some language mechanisms to express it.


Figure~\ref{fig:architecture} is an abstract view of how a P4 program
interacts with the data-plane of a packet-processing engine.  The
data-plane is a fixed-function device that provides several
programmable ``holes''. The user writes a P4 program to ``fill'' each
hole.  The target manufacturer describes the interfaces between the
programmable blocks and the surrounding fixed-function blocks.  These
interfaces are target-specific.  Note that the fixed-function part can
be software, hardware, firmware, or a mixture.

A P4 architecture file is expected to contain declarations of types,
constants, and a description of the control and parser blocks that the
users need to implement.  Sections~\ref{sec:ebpf} and~\ref{sec:xdp}
contain examples P4 architecture description files.

\subsection{eBPF for network processing}

\mycomment{(This section is adapted from~\cite{p4-ebpf-backend}.) }
eBPF is a
acronym that stands for Extended Berkeley Packet Filters. In essence,
eBPF is a low-level programming language (similar to machine code);
eBPF programs are traditionally executed by a virtual machine that
resides in the Linux kernel. eBPF programs can be inserted and removed
from a live kernel using dynamic code instrumentation. The main
feature of eBPF programs is their static safety: prior to execution
all eBPF programs have to be validated as being safe, and unsafe
programs cannot be executed. A safe program provably cannot compromise
the machine it is running on:
\begin{itemize}
\item it can only access a restricted set of memory regions (verified
  either statically or through inline bounds checks using
  software-fault isolation techniques~\cite{wahbe:93}),
\item it can run only for a limited amount of time; during execution
  it cannot block, sleep or take any locks,
\item it cannot use any kernel resources with the exception of a
  limited set of kernel services which have been specifically
  whitelisted, including operations to manipulate tables (described
  below)
\end{itemize}

\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Kernel hooks}

eBPF programs are inserted into the kernel using hooks; their
execution is triggered when the flow of control reaches these hooks:


\begin{itemize}
\item function entry points can act as hooks; attaching an eBPF
  program to a function foo() will cause the eBPF program to execute
  every time some kernel thread executes foo().

\item eBPF programs can also be attached using the Linux Traffic
  Control (TC) subsystem, in the network packet processing
  datapath. Such programs can be used as TC classifiers and actions.

\item eBPF programs can also be attached to sockets or network
  interfaces. In this case they can be used for processing packets
  that flow through the socket/interface.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{eBPF Maps}

The eBPF runtime exposes a bi-directional kernel- to user-space data
communication channel, called maps.  eBPF maps are essentially
key-value tables, where keys and values are arbitrary fixed-size
bitstrings.  The key width, value width and the maximum number of
entries that can be stored in a map are declared at map creation time.

In user-space, maps are are exposed as file descriptors. Both user- and
kernel-space programs can manipulate maps by inserting, deleting,
looking up, modifying, and enumerating entries.

In kernel-space, the keys and values are exposed as pointers to the raw
underlying data stored in the map, whereas in user-space the
pointers point to copies of the data.

\subsubsection{Concurrency}

The execution of an eBPF program is triggered by the corresponding
kernel hook; multiple instances of the same kernel hook can be running
simultaneously on different cores.

A map may be accessed simultaneously by multiple instances of the same
eBPF program running as separate kernel threads on different cores.
eBPF maps are native kernel objects, and access to the map contents is
protected using the kernel RCU mechanism. This makes access to table
entries safe under concurrent execution; for example, the memory
associated to a value cannot be accidentally freed while an eBPF
program holds a pointer to the respective value.  However, accessing
maps is prone to data races; since eBPF programs cannot use locks,
some of these races often cannot be avoided.

\subsection{XDP: eXpress Data Path}\label{sec:xdp-background}

An XDP program is special case of an eBPF program for processing
network packets, which attaches to the lowest levels of the networking
stack~\cite{xdpconext18}.  XDP was designed initially for quickly computing whether a
packet should be dropped, before too many kernel resources have been
allocated, to prevent denial-of-service attacks.  An XDP program can
inspect a network packet right after the DMA engine copies the packet
from the network card and can also access eBPF maps.

The kernel expects an XDP program to return the decision taken about the 
processed packet, one of the
following values:

\begin{description}
\item[XDP\_DROP] the packet should be immediately dropped,
\item[XDP\_TX] bounce the received packet back on the same port it arrived on,
\item[XDP\_PASS] continue to process the packet using,
  the normal kernel network stack,
\item[XDP\_REDIRECT] forward the packet to another port.
\end{description}

\subsection{Comparison of P4 and eBPF}

A very thorough evaluation of eBPF for writing networking programs can
be found in~\cite{minao-hspr18}.  P4 and eBPF share many features.
Table~\ref{table:compare} shows a comparison of the high-level
features of both languages.

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Feature comparison between P4 and eBPF.}\label{table:compare}
  \end{center}
\end{table}

P4 was designed as a language for programming switching devices,
working mostly at levels L2 and L3 of the networking stack.  While P4
is being used for programming network end-points, e.g., smart NICs,
some end-point functionality cannot be naturally expressed in P4
(e.g., TSO, encryption, deep packet inspection).


Many of these P4 limitations are shared with eBPF.  In general, while
P4 and eBPF are good for performing relatively simple packet
filtering/rewriting, neither language is good enough to implement a
full end-point networking stack.  Table~\ref{table:limitations}
compares the limitations of P4 and eBPF.
